# (2024) Nature Communications Biology, Rummagene: massive mining of gene sets from supporting materials of biomedical research publications

- https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-024-06177-7
- **Rummagene** aggregates mammalian gene sets from over **5.4 million PubMed Central articles**, surfacing **642,389 gene sets** from **121,237 articles**.

- The platform supports **enrichment analysis**, **free text search**, and **table title search**, enabling insights into **transcription factor and kinase enrichment** as well as **gene function prediction**.


- It provides gene sets, and references.  One can try to use abstract to enrich the dataset of gene sets.
- It is possible to create links between gene set and disease (gene name in one table, disease name in another table).
- Function prediction: 1) create similarities between genes, 2) predict unknown genes.  3) compare the predicted result from GO.

- other relevant data:
  - 1) understudied gene sets, 2) about kinases, 3) transcription factors, 4) top 10 predicted genes for terms from GO, GWAS Catalog, MGI Mammalian Phenotypes, and WikiPathways, 5-8) clusted unique gene sets to Rummagene. 9) commonly detected proteins from mass-spec, highly cited genes, and highly expressed genes.
